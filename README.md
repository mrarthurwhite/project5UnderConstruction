This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).



### `npm start in the rc-wordlist folder`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `rails -s in the api-wordlist folder`

Before you run the project you need to run rails -s (or start the rails server in the api-wordlist directory)
this is because the front end interacts with the backend rails API.

### What this project does
The project when started allows a user to view a wordlist , add new words to the word list etc.
